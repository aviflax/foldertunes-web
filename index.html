            <details><summary><h2>Why?</h2></summary>
                <p>It’s 2026, and the iPhone is 19 years old and is one of the 3 most successful computing platforms in history.</p>
                <p>Right now ~1.5 billion people carry iPhones.</p>
                <p>And yet it still has no built-in, standalone way to <no-br>play music files!</no-br></p>
                <p>If you buy music files from Bandcamp and download them right on your phone, you have no good way <no-br>to play them.</no-br></p>
                <p>If a friend shares a bootleg with you via AirDrop, you have no good way <no-br>to play it.</no-br></p>
                <p>That’s because the iPhone’s default Music app can’t play or import files or folders right on the phone.
                   For historical reasons, you’d need to use a traditional computer to “sync” those files into the Music app.</p>
                <p>You have a supercomputer in your pocket but it’s hampered by obsolete strategy taxes.</p>
                <p>It’s well past time to fix this.</p>
